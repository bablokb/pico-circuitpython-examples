# Pico CircuitPython Examples
This repo contains CircuitPython example code for Pimoroni RP2040 boards and our Pico Bases and Packs: https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/pico

## Getting Started

- Download a version of CircuitPython for your board at https://circuitpython.org/downloads
- Hold down the BOOT button whilst plugging in the USB cable or pressing RESET to go into DFU mode - your board will show up as a drive on your computer called `RPI-RP2`.
- Drag the newly downloaded CircuitPython .uf2 to the `RPI-RP2` drive - it will then reboot running CircuitPython (and will show up as a drive called `CIRCUITPY`).
- Edit `code.py` on the CIRCUITPY drive with any text editor - when saved your code will run automatically. If you need access to the serial output from the board (useful for viewing errors and troubleshooting your code), consider downloading Mu - https://codewith.mu/

## Additional Libraries

Some code in this repo uses additional CircuitPython libraries. You can find these in the CircuitPython library bundle at https://circuitpython.org/libraries - make sure to download the bundle that matches your version of CircuitPython! Once you've located the relevant file or directory, copy it into the `lib` folder on `CIRCUITPY`.

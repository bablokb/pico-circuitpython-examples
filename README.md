# pico-circuitpython-examples
This repo contains CircuitPython example code for Pimoroni RP2040 boards.

## Getting Started

- Download a version of CircuitPython for your board at https://circuitpython.org/downloads
- Hold down the BOOT button whilst plugging in the USB cable or pressing RESET to go into DFU mode - your board will show up as a drive on your computer called `RPI-RP2`.
- Drag the newly downloaded CircuitPython .uf2 to the 'RPI-RP2' drive - it will then reboot running CircuitPython (and will show up as a drive called CIRCUITPY).
- Edit `code.py` on the CIRCUITPY drive with any text editor - when saved your code will run automatically. If you need access to the serial output from the board, consider downloading Mu - https://codewith.mu/

## Additional Libraries

Most code in this repo uses additional CircuitPython libraries. You can find these in the CircuitPython library bundle at https://circuitpython.org/libraries - make sure to download the one that matches your version of CircuitPython!
